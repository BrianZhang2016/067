## Idea
Valorant website where you can upload and like clips of other players.

## Visual thoughts
Have a bar on top with the home button in the top left corner with "Guns", "Maps", "Agents" aligned with a search button and an upload button. This website is a Youtube-based website where the left side of the website has the main video playing while you have other recommend videos showing on the right side. There are other features such as the follow and like button beneath the video, the person's username that provided the video above the clip, and ads that lead to other interesting games. Overall, if even it may look like it's a replica of Youtube, it mainly focuses on Valorant and provides specific clips that the user wants.

### Organize with Bootstrap menu
Under our bootstraps, we implemented different categories that match with the main category given. 

### Implementation progress (August 13th, 2021)
#### Scrum Master, Developer - Nathan
Nathan has developed the abilities to write the Greet.html and designed our scrumboard so that each individual in the team has the chance to complete the task that they were given. Under each category, it provides every single character or weapon and the clips that are provided by them. It organizes our website so that the user doesn't always have to use the search bar in order to find what they want.
#### Designer - Reinhardt 
Reinhardt has expanded his knowledge on the navigation bar and how it functions. 
#### Technical Lead - Brian
This week, Brian has recorded notes 
#### Navigators - Derrick

### IDE management (things that happened beyond plan)
We finished our tasks this week, but we decided to go further and design our website on Google Slides. Though, it may not be realistic because we only made a simplistic design that doesn't function with working buttons that leads you to other detailed ideas about our website. Nathan and Reinhardt has found out how the bootstrap and the navigation bar work so we are currently trying to design our website on IntelliJ.
