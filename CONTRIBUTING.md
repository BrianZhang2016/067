# Contributing GuideLines

The following is our set of Guidelines for contrubing to our website/project.

## Pull Requests

You can create Pull Requests from our [GitHub.com](https://github.com/BrianZhang2016/067/pulls)

After initializing a pull request:
- A review page with high level overview of the changes between your branch and the repository's main branch will appear 
- You can add summaries of the proposed changes
- Review the changes from the commits
- Add labels, Milestones, and assignees to better organize
- Mention individual contributors or teams
After creating a pull request:
You can push commits from your topic branch to your existing pull request
- Appears in chronological within pull request
- Changes will be visible in the "Files changed" tab
Other contributors can:
- Review proposed changes
- Add review comments
- Contribute to pull request discussions
- Add comments to pull requests
In "Conversation" tab you can see...
- Branch's current deployment status
- Past deployment activity
After Pull Request is completed:
- Solo: Merge Pull Request
- Team: You or a teammate could merge your changes into the main branch
Linking Pull Request to Issue:
- Shows fix is in progress
- Automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request
