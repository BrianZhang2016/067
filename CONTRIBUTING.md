# Contributing GuideLines

The following is our set of Guidelines for contrubing to our website/project.

## Pull Requests

You can create Pull Requests from [GitHub.com](https://github.com/BrianZhang2016/067/pulls)
After starting a pull request:
- A review page with high level overview of the changes between your branch and the repository's main branch will appear 
- You can add summaries of the proposed changes
- Review the changes from the commits
- Add labels, Milestones, and assignees to better organize
- Mention individual contributors or teams

When pushing commits to a pull request, **NEVER** Force Push.
- Force Pushing could change the repository history and corrput your pull request 
- Banched work before the force push may overwrite the commits that the collaborators are basing their work off of
